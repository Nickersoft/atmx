Instead of constantly coming back to this site to copy code, you can easily use the atmx CLI to install functions directly in your project.

You can either install the CLI as a dev dependency, or invoke it directly using your favorite package manager:

```bash
npx atmx
yarn dlx atmx
pnpm dlx atmx
bunx atmx
```

Running any of these commands will display the help menu for the CLI.
