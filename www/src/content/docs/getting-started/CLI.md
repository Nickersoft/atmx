Instead of constantly coming back to this site to copy code, you can easily use the atmx CLI to install functions directly in your project.

There are a few different ways you can leverage the CLI:

```bash
# Invoke directly via npx
npx atmx

# Install globally
npm -g atmx

# Install in your project
npm i -D atmx # Then npm run atmx
```
