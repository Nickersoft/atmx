If you'd like to contribute to atmx by submitting helpful code snippets, simply add a TSDoc-annotated function to the appropriate category in `packages/registry/src`. Documentation will automatically be generated and your function will be immediately available once you [merge your PR](https://github.com/Nickersoft/atmx/pulls).

What we currently need help with the most is merging in more React hooks from [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) and [usehooks](https://github.com/uidotdev/usehooks).
